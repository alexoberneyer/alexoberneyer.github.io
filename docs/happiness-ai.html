        <p>AI will enable anyone to do anything. This will be empowering but will also create huge differences between people with high and low agency.</p>
<p>To keep everyone happy, there are a couple of options. Here are two of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>decrease the ceiling.</li>
<li>increase the floor.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think option 2 is the better option. When everyone is at least as wealthy as upper middle class in northern european countries, everyone will be happy.</p>
<p>There will be free education, healthcare, travel and other amenities.
With a really good life, you are fine with people much richer than yourself.</p>
