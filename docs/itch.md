A non-obvious reason why scratching your own itch results in a better product: your customers will be similar to you. This has two advantages:

1. You can better relate to and anticipate their issues, enabling you to build a stronger product.
2. More importantly, you will like your customers. This makes your work much more enjoyable for both you and them.

In short, scratching your own itch leads not only to a better product, but also makes building it more fun.
