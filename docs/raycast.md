I've been using Raycast for a few months now, and I've never felt better. I have more energy, my skin is clearer, and my eyesight has even improved. There are five main functions I use regularly:

1. **Snippets**
2. **Quicklinks**
3. **Extensions** (e.g., Jira, Git)
4. **Clipboard History**
5. **Script Commands**

These features are truly awesome, and I highly recommend them. Below, I'll describe each in more detail so you can tailor them to your own workflow.


## Snippets

The snippet function allows you to save text snippets that you use frequently for quick lookup and reuse. I use snippets in two main ways:

- **Prompt Library:** I store prompts like "Explain this code snippet in simple terms" or "Refactor this function for better readability." I also keep prompt starters like "Acting as a senior developer, please review..." that I can complete with specific context.
- **Quick Links:** I save my Calendly booking link, company wiki URLs, and frequently referenced documentation. For example, typing "cal" instantly gives me my scheduling link to paste in emails.


## Quicklinks

Quicklinks are an extension of the links I keep in snippets. If I want to paste a link into a text, I use snippets. But if I want to go directly to a link, I use a quicklink. For example, I have quicklinks for the homepage of our data analysis dashboard, specific JIRA issues (by key), or other bookmarks I need to access quickly.

To clarify the difference: snippets are for inserting text (like pasting a link into an email), while quicklinks are for navigation (like opening a dashboard in your browser). Think "paste" vs "go to."


## Extensions

Extensions take things a step further. They‚Äôre especially useful for tools like Git, JIRA, and more. Raycast already offers many extensions. For example, if I want to create or search for a JIRA issue but don‚Äôt know the key, I can use the JIRA extension.


## Clipboard History

The history feature is great for finding things I‚Äôve typed or copied recently (even from a few days ago). I can search my clipboard history, find what I need, and add it wherever necessary.


## Script Commands

Script commands are a bit more advanced, as they require some coding knowledge. You can add scripts that execute directly from Raycast. Here are a couple of scripts I use:

- **Emoji Replacement:** Since I use JIRA, email, and Teams, each with different emoji sets, I have a script that converts ":thumbsup:" to üëç for email but to (y) for Teams messages.
- **To-Do Aggregator:** I organize my notes in topic-specific folders like work, ideas, and projects, with todos written as `* [ ] task` in markdown. A Python script aggregates all todos across these folders into a single overview, keeping context about where each task originated.


Raycast has fundamentally changed how I interact with my computer. Tasks that used to require multiple clicks or remembering exact URLs now happen with a few keystrokes. The initial setup takes maybe an hour, but the time savings compound daily.

The real power isn't in any single feature‚Äîit's in building a personalized command center that grows with your workflow. Start with snippets for your most common text, add a few quicklinks, and gradually expand from there. Your future self will thank you.
