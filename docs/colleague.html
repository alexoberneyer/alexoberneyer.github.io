        <h1>How to be a good colleague</h1>
<p>If you were to sum up this article in one sentence, it would be this: Be proactive.
If you'd ask me to give me a more detailed explanation I would tell you this:</p>
<p>I think there are an infinite number of ways to be a good colleague.
In my opinion the most important ones are the following four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being proactive</li>
<li>Helping your colleagues</li>
<li>Asking for help</li>
<li>Communicating well</li>
</ol>
<h2>Being proactive</h2>
<p>The most important thing about being a good colleague is to be proactive.
Being proactive means taking the initiative and making things happen.
Here's a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see a problem, fix it.</li>
<li>If you don't know, what to do, don't ask "What should I do?". Think about what you could do and ask "I have the following challenges. Here's what I think I could do. What do you think?"</li>
<li>If you see an opportunity, take it.
By being proactive, you'll make your colleagues life easier.
You'll also learn a lot more, because you'll be doing more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Helping your colleagues</h2>
<p>Whenever you can, help your colleagues.
This is an investment in your future.
Helping your colleagues makes them more likely to help you in the future.
There's a tradeoff here: if you help your colleagues too much, some might stop thinking for themselves.</p>
<p>It it is a one time task, that you can do in a couple of minutes, just do it.
If there is something that occurs regularly, show them how to do it themselves.
Better yet, show them how to figure it out themselves.</p>
<h2>How to ask for help</h2>
<p>There's only so much you can do yourself.
In many situations you'll need to ask your colleagues for help.
When asking for help, there's two extremes: not asking at all and asking instead of thinking.
Both are bad.</p>
<p>When you're not asking at all, you'll get stuck and can't make progress.
This is bad for you and your colleagues, because they will then have to do your work.</p>
<p>When you're asking instead of thinking, you're wasting your colleagues time.
You want to be somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is, to make a genuine effort to solve the problem yourself. If you can't solve it, you can ask your colleagues for help.</p>
<p>When asking for help, you should explain what you've tried and why it didn't work. Explain it in a detailed yet concise way. If you're not writing detailed enough, your colleagues will have to ask you for more details.
If you're writing too much, your colleagues will have to read more than necessary.</p>
<p>Start by writing it as detailed as possible. Once you're done, read it again and remove everything that's not necessary. In many cases, you'll find the solution yourself while writing the question.</p>
<p>This way you'll learn something and you save your colleagues time.
If you don't find the solution yourself, you'll have a good question to ask your colleagues.</p>
<h2>Communicating well</h2>
<p>It is better to overcommunicate than to undercommunicate.
So if you're not sure, if you should communicate something, do it.
Be radically transparent.
Everybody should know, what's on your mind.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There's infinitely more ways to be a good colleague.
But if you just stick to those four points, your colleagues will love you
and you'll be doing great work.</p>
