AI will enable anyone to do anything. This will be empowering but will also create huge differences between people with high and low agency.

To keep everyone happy, there are a couple of options. Here are two of them:

1. decrease the ceiling.
2. increase the floor.

I think option 2 is the better option. When everyone is at least as wealthy as upper middle class in northern european countries, everyone will be happy. 

There will be free education, healthcare, travel and other amenities. 
With a really good life, you are fine with people much richer than yourself.
