        <p>A non-obvious reason why scratching your own itch results in a better product: your customers will be similar to you. This has two advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can better relate to and anticipate their issues, enabling you to build a stronger product.</li>
<li>More importantly, you will like your customers. This makes your work much more enjoyable for both you and them.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, scratching your own itch leads not only to a better product, but also makes building it more fun.</p>
