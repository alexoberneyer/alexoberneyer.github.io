        <p>Naval once said: “Capitalism works because it makes you fire your best friend.”
I’ve always taken this to mean that markets value results over relationships. When deciding whether to hire someone — or buy a product — the choice usually comes down to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s more comfortable or convenient for you.</li>
<li>It’s higher quality than doing it yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nowadays, with all the tools and automation available, you can just do things. So most of the time it boils down to reason #1: the opportunity cost of doing it yourself is higher than the cost of buying.</p>
<p>This principle applies to individuals as well. If you want someone to hire you or buy your service, the benefit they get has to clearly outweigh the cost.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard the saying: “AI won’t replace you. Someone using AI will.” I think that’s close, but slightly incomplete. The fuller version is:
“AI won’t replace you. Someone using AI better than you, at your own job, will.”</p>
<p>The way to avoid being replaced by AI is simple: be the best at using AI in your field.</p>
<p>At the extreme, this could lead to massive platform effects — where the single best person at one particular task serves the entire world. If an all-knowing AGI ever arrives, and products or services become infinitely scalable, only the very best will serve anyone.</p>
<p>Until then, the goal is more achievable: be the best your customer knows, at a price they’re willing to pay.</p>
<p>So, to not get replaced by AI, make sure you’re better at using it than your boss, your customer, and your competition.</p>
