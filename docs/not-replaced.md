Naval once said: “Capitalism works because it forces you to fire your friends.”
I’ve always taken this to mean that markets value results over relationships. When deciding whether to hire someone — or buy a product — the choice usually comes down to two things:
1. It’s more comfortable or convenient for you.
2. It’s higher quality than doing it yourself.

Nowadays, with all the tools and automation available, you can just do things. So most of the time it boils down to reason #1: the opportunity cost of doing it yourself is higher than the cost of buying.

This principle applies to individuals as well. If you want someone to hire you or buy your service, the benefit they get has to clearly outweigh the cost.

You’ve probably heard the saying: “AI won’t replace you. Someone using AI will.” I think that’s close, but slightly incomplete. The fuller version is:
“AI won’t replace you. Someone using AI better than you, at your own job, will.”

The way to avoid being replaced by AI is simple: be the best at using AI in your field.

At the extreme, this could lead to massive platform effects — where the single best person at one particular task serves the entire world. If an all-knowing AGI ever arrives, and products or services become infinitely scalable, only the very best will serve anyone.

Until then, the goal is more achievable: be the best your customer knows, at a price they’re willing to pay.

So, to not get replaced by AI, make sure you’re better at using it than your boss, your customer, and your competition.
