        <p>I've been using Raycast for a few months now, and I've never felt better. I have more energy, my skin is clearer, and my eyesight has even improved. There are five main functions I use regularly:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Snippets</strong></li>
<li><strong>Quicklinks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Extensions</strong> (e.g., Jira, Git)</li>
<li><strong>Clipboard History</strong></li>
<li><strong>Script Commands</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These features are truly awesome, and I highly recommend them. Below, I'll describe each in more detail so you can tailor them to your own workflow.</p>
<h2>Snippets</h2>
<p>The snippet function allows you to save text snippets that you use frequently for quick lookup and reuse. I use snippets in two main ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt Library:</strong> I store prompts like "Explain this code snippet in simple terms" or "Refactor this function for better readability." I also keep prompt starters like "Acting as a senior developer, please review..." that I can complete with specific context.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Links:</strong> I save my Calendly booking link, company wiki URLs, and frequently referenced documentation. For example, typing "cal" instantly gives me my scheduling link to paste in emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quicklinks</h2>
<p>Quicklinks are an extension of the links I keep in snippets. If I want to paste a link into a text, I use snippets. But if I want to go directly to a link, I use a quicklink. For example, I have quicklinks for the homepage of our data analysis dashboard, specific JIRA issues (by key), or other bookmarks I need to access quickly.</p>
<p>To clarify the difference: snippets are for inserting text (like pasting a link into an email), while quicklinks are for navigation (like opening a dashboard in your browser). Think "paste" vs "go to."</p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>Extensions take things a step further. They‚Äôre especially useful for tools like Git, JIRA, and more. Raycast already offers many extensions. For example, if I want to create or search for a JIRA issue but don‚Äôt know the key, I can use the JIRA extension.</p>
<h2>Clipboard History</h2>
<p>The history feature is great for finding things I‚Äôve typed or copied recently (even from a few days ago). I can search my clipboard history, find what I need, and add it wherever necessary.</p>
<h2>Script Commands</h2>
<p>Script commands are a bit more advanced, as they require some coding knowledge. You can add scripts that execute directly from Raycast. Here are a couple of scripts I use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emoji Replacement:</strong> Since I use JIRA, email, and Teams, each with different emoji sets, I have a script that converts ":thumbsup:" to üëç for email but to (y) for Teams messages.</li>
<li><strong>To-Do Aggregator:</strong> I organize my notes in topic-specific folders like work, ideas, and projects, with todos written as <code>* [ ] task</code> in markdown. A Python script aggregates all todos across these folders into a single overview, keeping context about where each task originated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raycast has fundamentally changed how I interact with my computer. Tasks that used to require multiple clicks or remembering exact URLs now happen with a few keystrokes. The initial setup takes maybe an hour, but the time savings compound daily.</p>
<p>The real power isn't in any single feature‚Äîit's in building a personalized command center that grows with your workflow. Start with snippets for your most common text, add a few quicklinks, and gradually expand from there. Your future self will thank you.</p>
